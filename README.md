**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**  
  I would use the user needs to find the functional parts of the program that i am working on that are most important to the end users or client. The user stories help with this by giving the team to most valuable ideas to the end user. Most importantly the user stories help the developers to see the end-users perspective while creating requirments for it throught the test cases. 
  
**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
  At this point in my carrer I currently do develop any programs except for one in my school work. With that being said when I do, I use a template to map out by ideas. I believe that in the furture especially after this Software Development Life Cycle course I would use Agile. As agile is the most flexible and promotes team communicatoin throughout the whole process. One of the agile process that I would like to incorporate is Scrum, as said before it promotes a very high level of team communication. 
  
**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**   
  I beleive that a good team member follows the rules of the team and offers help when needed but is not over bearing. They also have a good attitude and the willingness to work well with others.
